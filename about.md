# About me

My name is Alex, but you can call me Pebloop.<br />
I'm a developer from France. I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.odialab.com/">Odia</a> as a junior engineer in R&D.
I'm specialized in software and XR, but I also do web (mostly backend), mobile, electronics and video games.
I code since I'm really young, started around 10 years old, and I'm still learning new things everyday.
You can find my projects on <a href="/projects">my projects page</a>.<br /><br />

You can also contact me anytime on my social media accounts :<br>
